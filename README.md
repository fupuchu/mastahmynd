Mastah Mynd: A Mastermind game but with numbers

This is for my WDI Project 1. Instead of using colors, I used numbers 0-5.

I ran into interesting bugs and had a ton of fun locating and fixing them.

One notable bug was where by the player can cheese the invalid inputs to keep guessing till they get the right combination. (Thanks Harry!)
